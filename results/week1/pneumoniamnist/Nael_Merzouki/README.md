**Notes:** Model can distinguish positive cases from negative one relatively well (auroc ~ 0.83) and has a good but not peerfect accuracy score (> 0.8). Model confidence and accuracy do not match too well (ece = 0.239). The imbalance of the dataset might explain the high ece and accuracy. Temperature scaling or class weighting could help improve ece score without impacting accuracy significantly.
